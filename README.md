Online Bakery System – Project (Jan 2024)
_______________________________________________________
Background:
My name is Mrs Pat Cake. I own a bakery called "To Pie For". I need to move with the times and therefore
require an e-commerce web site to be built for me. This will provide my customers online shopping facilities
from their homes and workplace. Very important for me during this COVID-19 period. Here are some of my
requirements.
Any potential customer must be able to sign up for free. Upon registration they will need to enter their name,
contact number, email address and a potential delivery address. Once signed up, they should be able to log in
to their account and browse all my awesome, delicious products they may want to purchase as their interest is
piqued.
Once on the site, a customer should be able to select a category of products they would like to browse. For
instance, cookies, cakes and cupcakes, fresh breads, pastries, pies, and brownies. As the customer browses,
they should be able to view prices and details of any selected items. These details must include any warnings
(e.g.: contains nuts) as well as nutrient information and ingredients contained in the product.
Should the customer want to purchase a product, they will need to select it and then place it into their
shopping cart. The customer must be able to continue to shop for more items after placing an item into the
shopping cart. Once completed with their shopping, the customer should proceed to the ‘checkout’.
At checkout time, all items placed in their shopping cart, along with the total amount to be paid is displayed as
“order ready” to the customer. Should the customer not want to continue with the order and cancel the process
(s)he should be able to do so. An option of being able to edit the order must be available before a customer
makes a final acceptance.
If (s)he proceeds with accepting the order, more information is required to complete the transaction. The
customer will be asked to fill an e-form providing information about the shipping address or confirm a delivery
address previously used. They will also be required to select a payment option such as credit/debit card or
EFT (incidentally, you do not have to implement a payment gateway, just create a ‘stub’ that will randomly
accept and reject payments).
Once an order is placed, an email notification must be sent to the customer acknowledging the order request.
For verification, the user must be e-mailed a copy of the shopping receipt after a successful payment
transaction.
Functionality:
• The system must provide a convenient interface for
◦ User Registration,
◦ Categories,
◦ Item Search and
◦ Payment
• Any guest to my web site must be able to view all my products.
• For any kind of shopping, the user must be registered and logged on to my system.
• My system must be able to show bakery products in their respective categories.
• My system must generate an invoice, which the customer must pay online.
• My system must provide a ‘Password Recovery’ facility through the customer’s email.
• An administrator of my system must be able to assign different options for sales (e.g.: 10%, 15%, and
20% discounts) on various bakery items.
• If an item is not available (‘out-of-stock’) and a customer selects it, an alert should be shown to the
customer that this item is ‘out-of-stock’. At present I do not want any orders to be placed on ‘out-ofstock’
items. My system must manage my stock efficiently.
• The customer must be able to view all their orders they placed.
• The administrator must be able to trace any order placed.
• My system must have a convenient ‘search’ allowing for the searching of any bakery item.
• Every order must be allocated a unique identifier (ORDER_ID).
• Likewise, each invoice must be associated with an order, and it too must have a unique identifier.
• My system must have both an administrator and customer role.
• The customer must be able to receive notifications via their email account.

Reports:
Reports, inter alia I require include the following:
1. Orders placed: This list can be generated alphabetically, or by category. I must be able to enter a single
day or a range of days.
2. Orders outstanding: Keeping track of which orders have not been delivered. I must be able to enter a
single day or a range of days, as well as a category.
3. Orders delivered: This list may be generated alphabetically or stipulated period.
4. Ingredients in stock: This list shows the ingredients in stock, in alphabetical order.
5. Ingredients required to be ordered: This list shows the ingredients, in alphabetical order I need to purchase
as my stock is running low.
Other information:
“It is a requirement that I be able to change my prices when needed. I would also like to have the functionality
of giving customers a discount, if deemed appropriate.”
“The system should allow a customer and administrator to add/edit their profile details, and if necessary (not
often) delete a customer. Customer details to be stored include, but are not limited to:
Name
Surname
Title
ID. Number
Delivery Address
Telephone Number (Mobile)
E-mail address”
“The system must allow me to add/edit all item details, and if necessary (not often) delete an item. Item details
to be stored include, but are not limited to:
Item title
Item description
Item warnings if any
Nutrient information
Ingredients
Picture of my creation
Category item belongs to”
“The system must allow me to add/edit all category details, and if necessary (not often) delete a category.”
“If possible, and time permitting I would really like my system must have a metrics/analytics section that is
viewable by an administrator of my system (requiring very basic ‘data mining’), which displays graphically:
• Number of orders placed per day, over a week (Monday – Sunday). This will provide me with information
about which days are the most popular.
• Chart (pie) displaying the popularity of the category of orders.
• Chart displaying the popularity of items per category.”
Performance Requirements:
• Ability to manage many customers connected to the website at the same time without crashing!
• Good performance and data transmission.
• Once logged in customers should be able to purchase items and view orders without re-entering
information.
Quality Attributes:
• Maintain a user-friendly environment that is visually appealing.
• Easy to see and navigate.
• Maintain readable content.

Other requirements:
The software should be able to run on any sort of environment, regardless of operating system. The database
must be either MySQL or PostgreSQL and the application server must be Tomcat or Glassfish.
Summary:
“These requirements are the minimum expected by me, Mrs Pat Cake for my system. Should you want to add
more functionality, please feel free to discuss this with the stakeholder, whom I have appointed and is
currently your lecturer. Remember; discuss this specification with her/him. Make sure you understand what is
required. Please note you have been given a very specific time frame to work in. Make sure you do not spend
too much time on ‘frills’; rather, complete a system for me that does the basics very well than something
that has frills yet does not work properly.”
You and your group are required to design an appropriate system incorporating the knowledge you gained
during Mecer Inter-Ed’s Java fundamentals, programming, and enterprise courses you attended. You and your
group need to present a fully integrated web application. You may incorporate other technologies you know,
for instance HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript or a front-end development framework such as Bootstrap.
Lastly - make sure you understand what is required. If you are uncertain about any issue regarding this project
discuss it with your lecturer.
Note: you have been given a very specific time frame in which you must complete your work. Make sure you
do not spend too much time on the ‘frills’; rather complete a system that does the basics very well than
something that has frills yet does not work.
